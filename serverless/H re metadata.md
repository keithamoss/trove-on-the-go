H re metadata:

"Is there good metadata attached to each individual pic in a series? E.g. When I search Trinity Arcade, I get a wall of thumbnails for the pics in each series, most of which are unrelated to Trinity, because there happens to be a single Trinity pic in the series."

1. What metadata do we get back from Trove for the individual photos? It's just URLs, not titles right?
   A. Photo title - and that's it
2. What metadata does SLWA have about individual photos?
   A. Just what we see

Searches like 'boans' have similar issues where it appears in the description somewhere, but not the title.

Show H next time she's around and discuss solutions / work arounds.

Talk to H about the best way to handle year ranges (instead of just taking the lower range)

# Discussion and actions

- Set a threshold of n on the Trove results
- Order photo thumbnails by relevance (full match for all terms, partial match for terms, no match)
- Only show the first n photo thumbnails and then show a "and n more" placeholder
- Add a UI setting (later) to toggle to "Show everything" or "Show just irrelevant"
